Key take- aways: Threat landscape awareness recognised current attack vectors (malware, phishing, social engineering) and their business impact. Security by design principles applied least- privilege, defence- in- depth and zero- trust concepts to small- scale network scenarios. Protective controls evaluated baseline safeguards: multi- factor authentication, endpoint protection, encryption, secure browsing and patch management. Incident- response essentials walked through the NIST response cycle (prepare, detect, contain, eradicate, recover) and basic log- analysis techniques. User centric risk reduction developed best- practice guidelines for secure passwords, safe email/IM usage and mobile- device hygiene Python Programming Basics - Information Technology Institute April 2025 Structured foundations mastered Python syntax, data types (strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries), operators, and control structures (conditionals, loops) for clean, readable code. Functional programming basics created and invoked user- defined functions, leveraged *args/**kwargs, and applied lambda expressions to promote modular design and reusability. File & data handling performed text and CSV I/O, practiced exception handling, and utilized the OS and pathlib libraries to automate routine file system tasks. Standard- library fluency employed datatime, math and random modules to solve real- world problems without external dependencies. Debugging & testing discipline used the interactive REPL and pdb to trace logic, and introduced unittest for basic test driven validation. Assessment performance achieved the required benchmark score in a timed capstone quiz featuring code tracing questions and hands on script challenges.
